This project is intended to be used to upgrade the existing systems and enhance its
functionalities where it can serve better recommendations to the users. It focuses more on
the users personal data such as location, his liking’s for particular restaurants, his spending
limit etc. The system we intend to make, shall make use algorithms such as Content-based
filtering Collaborative filtering for personalised recommendation. By the end of the project,
the system is intended to serve recommendation to a user by calculating his likeliness towards
a particular restaurant and similarity between various other users which can further improve
the user’s experience by giving it more accurate results.

We introduce a new recommendation system for restaurants that infuse personalization,
ubiquity and location based service to take a user’s dining experience to the next level. We
would be developing a recommendation system that would use ubiquitous algorithm to study
the user’s behavior through the preferences he saved. Information extraction (IE) is the task
of locating specific pieces of information from a document, thereby obtaining useful structured
data from unstructured text. Later we plan to develop a website for the system. We will
use collaborative and content based filtering. The systems working can be divided into 2
sections, online activity and offline processing. The online activity will consist of interaction
with the user asking for preferences which will be used for further activities. On basis of this
data, the system will generate recommendations accordingly.


We have uploaded the data (CSV) file separately.
